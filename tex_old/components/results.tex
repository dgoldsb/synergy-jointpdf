\subsection{Assumption Checks}

% TSNE
The t-SNE plots do support our assumption that we are sampling only a subspace of all possible systems with our GRN-like random systems.
We show two t-SNE plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:TSNE}, for both a smaller and larger system\footnote{Additional plots can be found in the repository \url{github.com/dgoldsb/synergy-jointpdf}}.
We see a very clear division between the completely random systems (red) and the biologically inspired systems (blue).
The fact that here and there a random system is mixed in with the biologically inspired system further indicates that we are dealing with a small subspace; there is a small chance when sampling from the complete space to draw a system from the subspace.

% Cycles
We find that biologically inspired systems are much less likely to contain cycles than entirely random systems.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cycles} we show a distribution of the maximum cycle length for a small and large system.
We see that in the smallest systems some small cycles are formed for the GRN-like model.
These cycles, however, disappear once the system size is increased.
We find that the number of system states $l$ does not have a noticable impact on the cycle distribution in biological systems; we see that cycles become much less likely when increasing the system size, but not when increasing the number of system states. % this is weird, because in both cases we increase the number of states
As there is always either a cycle or a sink, a maximum cycle length of 1 is the lowest attainable for a system.

% Finding flower motifs, skip for now

% Normality and all
In our parameter sweep we drew a large number of separate samples containting the synergy, memory, and resilience-properties of networks.
We found that most of these sample where not normally distributed.
Furthermore, those that did fit a normal distribution often contained outliers, and had wildly varying variances.
As such, we do not meet the assumptions for a t-test for comparing means, and for the Pearson test of correlation.
To handle the sample correctly we use non-parametric statistics in all further analysis, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Spearman test of correlation. % these tests throw away the actual values, so outliers  are no problem either, they will simply get the highest/lowest rank

\subsection{Comparisons GRN and Random Systems}

We compared the level of synergy measured in random and biologically inspired systems for varying system sizes and number of states.
We found that completely random systems carry significantly more synergy than the biological systems in all cases.
These results are compiled in Table~\ref{synergy}.

\label{synergy}
\end{table}

We similarly compared the level of memory measured in random and biologically inspired systems for varying experiments.
We found that completely random systems carry significantly more memory than the biological systems in most cases. % this is to be expected, the memory is really really high
These results are compiled in Table~\ref{memory}.

\label{memory}
\end{table}

We did find a consistent difference in the impact of nudging a single variable.
As shown in Table~\ref{resilience_single}, the nudge impact is higher in random networks.

\label{resilience_single}
\end{table}


We found a similar consistent difference in the impact of nudging all variables.
As shown in Table~\ref{resilience_multiple} in the appendix, the nudge impact is consistently higher in random networks.
It appears that models with a higher number of states (a higher resolution in the expression level dimension), by virtue of having more expression levels, show a stronger difference in the nudge impact.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:3dscatter} we provide several scatterplots of experiments, with varying system sizes and numbers of expression levels.
We find that the variance reduces significantly when increasing the number of possible states, showing a much clearer pattern.
The same effect is seen in when increasing the system size.
This is likely due to the increase in the sample space; the sample space grows strongly when increasing either the system size or number of possible states.
We notice that random systems are very tightly clustered, and typically have an extremely high memory paired with high synergy.
The biological systems are much more spread out, and while there are outliers with higher memory than any random system, most samples have a lower memory and synergy.
The spread of nudge impacts is also much high in biological systems than in random systems.

\subsection{Spearman Results}
% TODO: report min/max somewhere?

In our correlation experiments we find a weak correlation between the synergy and the memory in a system.
An increase in synergy appears to be paired with a decrease in memory, as shown in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_syn_mem}.
This relation is not strong, however, and only consistently significant in larger systems with more than two expression levels.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:3dscatter} we see that the range over which the observed synergy varies is very large for biological networks, but smaller for random networks.
Combinations of low synergy and high memory never occur.
In Table~\ref{random_rho_syn_mem}, we observe the same a highly significant and relationship between synergy and memory.
In random networks, this relationship appears to be much stronger.
However, the random sample only covers the high synergy-range.
As such, the random networks also do not populate the low synergy-high memory space.

\label{random_rho_syn_mem}
\end{table}

In only some cases do we observe a significant relationship between synergy and the impact of a single target nudge (Table~\ref{GRN_rho_syn_singleimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_syn_singleimpact}).
In very small systems, with 2 nodes and 2 states, this correlation was positive.
In larger systems this correlation, if significant, was negative.
The correlation was significant more often and stronger in random systems, meaning that an increase in synergy had a larger effect in these systems on the resilience.
However, some $p$-values are relatively high, as they fall in the range $0.05 > p > 0.005$.
As we do close to 40 experiments, we should be wary of false positives by chance; with this number of experiments, results with a $p$-value of $p < 0.001$ should be considered with care.
%Furthermore, the found correlations are weak, implying that even if they are significant they might not be relevant. % TODO: move this to results?

We find the same a significant relationship between synergy and the impact of a nudge that targets all variables in the system (Table~\ref{GRN_rho_syn_singleimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_syn_singleimpact} in the Appendix).
Again, we find only several experiments with a $p$-value in the range $0.05 > p > 0.005$, and with a low correlation $r_S$, and that the correlation is stronger in random networks

We provide similar results Table~\ref{GRN_rho_mem_singleimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_mem_singleimpact} for memory instead of synergy.
We find that there is a strong positive relationship between memory and nudge impact.
This is not unsurprising; synergy and memory where found to be negatively correlated, and synergy and nudge impact where also foudn to be negatively correlated.
This result is also observed in the correlation between memory and the impact of a nudge that targets all genes (Table~\ref{GRN_rho_mem_multimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_mem_multimpact} in the appendix).
%It appears from this result that the information in the random variable memory that is uncorrelated with the synergy is not correlated with nudge impact either.

\subsection{MI-Profile}

In the MI-profiles, we find that the synergy-redundancy ratio is less balanced in biology-like systems than in completely random systems.
Like in previous experiments, we find that increasing the number of possible expression levels $l$ makes the difference between the two system types more pronounced.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:profilel4}, we show the ensembles of MI-profiles for both random and GRN-like systems.
We find that random systems stay much closer to a straight line than GRN-like systems, implying that at all levels similar amounts of redundancy and synergy occur.
In biological systems, this balance is less present, as we see that in many samples there is much more redundancy oynergy at some levels.
This is less present, but still noticable, for fewer expression levels (Fig.~\ref{fig:profilel2}).
