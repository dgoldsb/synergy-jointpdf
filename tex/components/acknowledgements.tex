I would like to thank Rick Quax for supervising this project, and helping to find a way to realize the idea of looking for synergy in biological complex systems.
I also want to thank Derkjan Riesthuis for brainstorming and providing feedback on this work.
Finally, I would like to thank Gokhan Ertaylan for providing information on current research into gene regulatory systems, and on the viability of using empirical data in this study, which unfortunately was not possible.
