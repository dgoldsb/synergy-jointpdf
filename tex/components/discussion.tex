Ideally, we would use a sample of empirically obtained datasets.
However, due to the limited availability of datasets that are both suitable (i.e. an ODE model) and small enough for analysis, this was not possible.
Our resort to generated GRN-like networks was the next best alternative, but raises doubts about the extend to which our results can be generalized to all biological complex systems.

As the accurate description of GRNs as ODE systems is relatively new territory, networks are not very accurate yet.
The ODE system used in this study has a corresponence of nearly 50\% to emperical data.
We think that, while these models are still not truly representative for real systems, these sytems should represent the type of dynamics in GRNs fairly well.
Much research is done on Boolean models, which simply work with a binary activation/deactivation system.
With the addition of reaction rates, the model used captures reality better than these Boolean models.
Furthermore, we think that the addition of reaction rates, even when not fully corresponding to reality, will add enough extra informaton to bridge the problem that network motifs only do not predict function.
