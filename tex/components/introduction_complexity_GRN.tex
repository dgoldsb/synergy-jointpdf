% Something about IT in GRN research
\cite{zhang2012chaotic}

% The state of network simulation

% Boolean networks
Peixoto so far
bivariate 21, 22
Justify continuous against RBN
They work under strong assumptions (for example inhibition dominates etc) \cite{}
We need an extension
motif has vastly different functions \cite{ingram2006network}
more elaborate model, binding constants	\cite{ingram2006network}
Shlitt

Have to say, tononi1999measures suggest that robustness is due to degeneracy and redundancy, not due to synergy in neural networks

% ODE motifs

% Full motifs

% From Boolean to ODE models
ODE models are interesting, rate fitting is the problem. This one \cite{kuhn2009monte}.
