% Give meaning to what synergy is

Synergy (...)

% Talk about pertubation resistance, link to biology
It has been hypothesized by Quax et al. that synergy increases the resilience of a system against pertubation in a single input variable \cite{quax2017quantifying}. 
This means that synergy can be utilized to make a system resistant to nudges, while retaining the ability to memorize previous states. 
These are essential features in biological networks, which need to be both resilient to minor disturbances, but were also future states of the system should retain much of the information from previous states.

% Give comprehensive overview what has been done
Discuss what has been done already (pairwise profile).

% Hypotheses (move to end introduction)
Make hypothesis maximum vs. average different.
