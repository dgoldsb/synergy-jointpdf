\subsection{Assumption checks}

\subsubsection{Sample space}

% TSNE
The t-SNE plots support our assumption that we are sampling only a subspace of all possible systems with our GRN-like random systems.
We show two t-SNE plots in Fig.~\ref{fig:TSNE}, for both a smaller and larger system\footnote{As it is not possible to include all plots for every experiment in the paper, we make a representative selection, and all plots are available in the repository \url{github.com/dgoldsb/synergy-jointpdf}.}.
For larger systems, we see a very clear division between the URMs (red crosses) and the BRMs (blue circles).
It is important to keep in mind that t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction method that clusters similar data points.
As such, the fact that one color does not visibly contain another has no implication on whether one of the two is a subsample.
The fact that BRMs and URMs are separated, and that there are large portions of the URM-cluster that have no BRMs mixed in does indicate that we are dealing with a small subspace; it seems possible to sample a BRM when drawing a URM, but not always the other way around.
This also suggests that sampling transition tables from the set of BRMs yields transition tables with similar properties.
For very small systems the sample space is very small, it seems that in this case the BRMs are less easily distinguished from the URMs.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Transition cycles}

% Cycles
We find that BRMs are much less likely to contain transition cycles than URMs.
In Fig.~\ref{fig:cycles} we show a distribution of the maximum cycle length for a small and large system.
We see that in the smallest systems some small cycles are formed for the GRN-like model.
These cycles, however, disappear once the system size is increased.
As there is always either a cycle or a sink, a maximum cycle length of 1 is the lowest attainable for a system.

\subsubsection{Normality and outliers}

% Normality and all
To determine if the Pearson test for correlation and the Student's t-test for comparing means were suitable, we checked our sample for normality and outliers.
In our parameter sweep we drew a large number of separate samples containing the synergy, memory, and resilience-properties of networks.
We found that most of these sample were not normally distributed.
Furthermore, those that did fit a normal distribution often contained outliers, and suffered from varying variances.
As such, we do not meet the assumptions for a t-test for comparing means, and for the Pearson test of correlation.
To handle the sample correctly we use non-parametric statistics in all further analysis, such as the Wilcoxon signed-rank test and the Spearman test of correlation. % these tests throw away the actual values, so outliers  are no problem either, they will simply get the highest/lowest rank

\subsection{Comparisons GRN and Random Systems}

We compared the level of synergy measured in URMs and BRMs for varying system sizes and number of states.
We found that completely random systems carry significantly more synergy than the biological systems in all cases.
These results are compiled in Table~\ref{synergy}.

\label{synergy}
\end{table}

We similarly compared the level of memory measured in URMs and BRMs for varying experiments.
We found that completely random systems carry significantly more memory than the biological systems in most cases. % this is to be expected, the memory is really really high
These results are compiled in Table~\ref{memory}\footnote{The implementation of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test returns a $T$-statistic of zero when the two samples share zero overlap in their range.}.

\label{memory}
\end{table}

We did find a consistent difference in the impact of nudging a single variable.
We illustrate in Table~\ref{resilience_single} that the impact of a local nudge was found to be higher in random networks.
We found a similar consistent difference in the impact of a global nudge.
As shown in Table~\ref{resilience_multiple} in the appendix, the nudge impact is consistently higher in random networks.
It appears that models with a higher number of states (a higher resolution in the expression level dimension), by virtue of having more expression levels, show a more significant difference in the nudge impact.
%Larger system experiments are closer to reality, as gene regulatory networks consist of many genes.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:3dscatter} we provide several scatterplots of experiments showing the distribution of memory, synergy, and resilience for both types of systems with varying system sizes and numbers of expression levels\footnote{2-dimensional versions of these plots are included in Fig.~\ref{fig:2d22}-\ref{fig:2d54} in Appendix~\ref{appendix_figures}}.
We find that the variance decreases significantly when increasing the number of possible states, showing a much clearer pattern.
The same effect is seen when increasing the system size.
This is likely due to the increase in the sample space; the sample space grows strongly when increasing either the system size or number of possible states.
We notice that URMs are very tightly clustered, and typically have an extremely high memory paired with high synergy.
The BRMs are much more spread out, and while there are outliers with higher memory than any random system, most samples have a lower memory and synergy.
The spread of nudge impacts is also much higher in biological systems than in random systems.

\subsection{Spearman Results}

\subsubsection{Correlation between synergy and memory}
% Relationship synergy and memory

An increase in synergy appears to be paired with a decrease in memory for BRMs, as shown in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_syn_mem}.
This relationship is not strong, however, and only consistently significant in larger systems with more than two expression levels.
In Table~\ref{random_rho_syn_mem}, we observe a highly significant and strong relationship between synergy and memory for URMs.
In URMs, this relationship appears to be much stronger than in BRMs.
The difference in the strength between these correlations can be explained by the fact that URMs always have a high memory, whereas BRMs occupy a wider range.

\subsubsection{Correlation between synergy and resilience}
% Relationship synergy and resilience

In some of our correlation experiments we find a weak negative correlation between the synergy and the impact of nudges on a single variable.
These results are compiled in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_syn_singleimpact}-\ref{random_rho_syn_multimpact} in the Appendix.
However, when we add the memory in the system as a confounding variable, this relationship disappears.
This is shown in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_partial_synergy_singleimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_partial_synergy_singleimpact}.
Only a few experiments yield a result with a $p$-value below our threshold of $\alpha = 0.05$.
However, these $p$-values are relatively high, and the sign of the observed effect is inconsistent.
As we carried out a large number of experiments with $\alpha$ as $0.05$, one in every twenty experiments is expected to lead to a false positive conclusion.
The statistically significant results could very well be attributed to chance.
We observed the same behavior when all system variables were included in the nudge, as can be seen in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_partial_synergy_multimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_partial_synergy_multimpact} in the Appendix.

\subsubsection{Correlation between memory and resilience}
% Relationship memory and resilience

We do observe a strong positive correlation between the memory and the impact of local nudges.
These results are compiled in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_mem_singleimpact}-\ref{random_rho_mem_multimpact} in the Appendix.
When we add the synergy in the system as a confounding variable, this relationship persists.
This relationship was most significant in BRMs.
This is shown in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_partial_memory_singleimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_partial_memory_singleimpact} for BRMs and URMs respectively.
The same behavior was observed when all system variables were included in the nudge, as can be seen in Table~\ref{GRN_rho_partial_memory_multimpact} and Table~\ref{random_rho_partial_memory_multimpact} in the Appendix.

\subsection{Full mutual information profile}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:profilel4}, we show the ensembles of complexity profiles for both URMs and BRMs.
In the complexity profiles, we find that excess synergy or redundancy is more common in BRMs than in URMs, as profiles tend to take much more extreme maximum and minimum values.
Like in previous experiments, we find that increasing the number of possible expression levels $l$ makes the difference between the two system types more pronounced.
We find that URMs stay much closer to a straight line than BRMs, implying that at all levels similar amounts of redundancy and synergy occur.
In biological systems, this balance is less present, as we see that in many samples there is much more redundancy synergy at some levels.
This is less present, but still noticeable, when there are fewer gene expression levels (Fig.~\ref{fig:profilel2}).
