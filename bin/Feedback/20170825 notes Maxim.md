# Notes based on thesis Maxim

* A start with the history of the problem is much niccer, so start with the ecology and IT part
* Models as a separate section, so for me GRN models, plus expand more; I can ive a lot more in-depth theoretical background!
* Consider separate section for scope of the thesis and research question, hypotheses
* Include some pseudocode in my methods section, for instance for the random network generation
* My sources count seems good, I am at 40+, he had 24
