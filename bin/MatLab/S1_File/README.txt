comparative
===========

Code used for comparative analysis of yeast metabolic network models. 

The \FBA tests subdirectory includes the scripts used to specify model medium, biomass definitions, and essential gene lists for FBA-based comparison of gene essentiality predictive accuracy for single and double gene deletions. These scripts can be run with the runanalysis.m script. 

The \doubles subdirectory includes the scripts and results of the double gene deletion simulations. 

The \models\backup folder includes matlab .mat files of the models. The \models\models_as_used subdirectory includes models with any modifications used for this analysis. 

The \scope comparison subdirectory includes the code used to compare metabolite and gene scope for the models.
