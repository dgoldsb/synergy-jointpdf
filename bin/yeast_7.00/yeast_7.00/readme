CURRENT VERSION: 7.00

three versions of the network are made available
* yeast_x.yz.xml, a model for use in flux analyses, in FBC format [http://sbml.org/Community/Wiki/SBML_Level_3_Proposals/Flux_Constraints]
* yeast_x.yz_cobra.xml, the same model, in Cobra format [http://opencobra.sf.net/]
* yeast_x.yz_recon.xml, a reconstruction containing only reactions for which there is experimental 
evidence

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHECKSUM  

maximal growth rate: 0.14057 flux units

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CONVERSION SBML TO TEXT FILE

can be performed for example using the Cobra toolbox and commands

>> model = readCbModel('yeast_x.yz_cobra.xml',inf);
>> writeCbModel(model,'text','yeast_x.yz.txt');

though this is not recommended as semantic annotations may be lost.

UPDATES

yeast 7.00: 19 apr 2013
* large update, as described in Hnin Aung, Susan Henry and Larry Walker: "Revising the 
representation of fatty acid, glycerolipid, and glycerophospholipid metabolism in the consensus 
model of yeast metabolism", Industrial Biotechnology (submitted)

yeast 6.06: 8 apr 2013

* slightly smaller model with a higher predictive accuracy of gene essentiality

yeast 5.01: 21 nov 2011
* final yeast 5 release 
* large increase in coverage, particularly with regard to sphingolipid metabolism
* increased compatibility with Cobra toolbox
* model can consume glucose (rate 1 flux unit), and ammonium, H+, iron(2+), oxygen, phosphate,
potassium, sodium, sulphate, water (unlimited rate) 
* no longer releasing in old SBML format - get the latest http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML

Messiha, Naglis Malys, Neil Swainston

yeast 4.05: 11 aug 2010
* final yeast 4 release 
* published in BMC Sys Bio 
* addition of lipid metabolism 
* Cobra format (http://opencobra.sf.net/) allowing contraint-based analyses to be performed
* following iMM904 (http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1752-0509-3-37), the ATP requirements of the cell are 
fixed at 1, and the the model can consume
